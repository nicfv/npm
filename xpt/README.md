## Getting Started

"xpt" is pronounced "expect" or "except." This package contains a simple assertion testing framework written in JavaScript. If any one of the `xpt` expectations fail, it will throw an exception and halt program execution. Exceptions can be caught using the standard `try ... catch` block.
