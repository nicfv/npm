You can use `Dimensional` to determine if a complex dimension matches a default dimension and return the name of that dimension.

Using the builtin JavaScript function [`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) on the default `dimension`, we can iterate through the result until it matches with the argument.
