# Number Input

This example demonstrates how to install the package, import the `NumberInput` class, and configure it. All configuration options are optional - none are required. If unset, they will be set to their default values (typically empty for strings and numbers, or `false` for boolean options.) In this example, we have created a new `NumberInput` and attached an event listener to it, on input.

> If this were a real web app, such as HTML5 barebones or React, you would use the `getElement()` function to append this element onto the parent.
