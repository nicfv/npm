# Blank Mollier Diagram

A Mollier diagram (or enthalpy-entropy diagram) has the same underlying principle as a psychrometric chart, except that the X and Y axes are flipped, and humidity ratio is plotted on the (now) horizontal axis instead of dew point.

In this example, we use Psychart to render a blank Mollier diagram on an empty HTML page. This example demonstrates some of the basic configuration options for Psychart.
