## Getting Started

Small math? Simple math? Or supplemental math? Canonically, "SMath" is pronounced "smath" and stands for "small math (library.)" Similar to JavaScript's builtin [`Math`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math) object, `SMath` exports one global object with several math-related helper functions. There is no need to instantiate the class, just call functions directly. See the examples below to get started using SMath!
