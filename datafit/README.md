## Installation

`datafit` can be installed from the official [npm package repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datafit). It is highly recommended to install the latest version, which is installed by default with the following command.

```shell
npm i datafit
```

## Getting Started

`datafit` exports only 1 function, [`fit`](https://npm.nicfv.com/datafit/functions/fit-1.html) which is used for curve fitting. All other exports are purely for information and defining types used within this package.

## Example

### Single Variable

In this example written in JavaScript, we will fit a 2nd degree polynomial to a set of (x,y) points.
