One day, you step onto a scale to determine your weight. It reads the number **150**. What is this number? It is the **force** you are applying on to the scale. Europeans would be terrified to see this number, but Americans wouldn't even think twice. See, in the United States, scales read out units of **pounds** where in Europe, it would read out units of **kilograms**. What would a European scale say your weight is?

Now, here's an interesting predicament - pounds are units of **force** whereas kilograms are units of **mass**, which are completely different **dimensions**. In reality, a European scale is also measuring the force you apply, but in a different unit, called **Newtons**.

> It just so happens that pounds are *also* units of mass, and on Earth, one pound of force equals one pound of mass. We'll get to this later.

So now that we know a European scale is actually measuring Newtons, what value would that be for \\\(150 [lb]\\\)? Based on results from plugging it into an online conversion calculator, I expect to see around \\\(667 [N]\\\). Let's see if it checks out.
