### Gradient

This example takes you through creating your own custom color gradient and generate valid CSS code for it. It also shows how to generate intermediate color values in between color stops. By default, `getColor()` will assume a normalize input value from 0 to 1, but if minimum and maximum bounds are given, it will automatically interpolate between them.
